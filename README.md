This is a challenge to implement an encryption technique, where a letter for a given word is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions up or down the alphabet.

Parameters

(string, number)


Returns
---------------------------
string.  

Fundementals Employed:
---------------------------
Loops, conditional Flow Logic, string methods, enumerables (map).

What I learnt:
---------------------------
Practise of enumerables, loops and conditional flow logic. Particularly problem solving how to wrap the alphabet based
on given ASCII ordinal number. Shifting that by given number. Then converting that back into the ASCII character.
